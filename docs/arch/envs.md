# Environments & provisioning

How ABA provides the software a run executes in — Python and R — and how it adds
packages on demand without corrupting shared state.

> The maintained reference for how environments work.

## Aims & principles

The scientific stack is **ABI-fragile**: every compiled package (numpy, scipy, scanpy,
numba, torch…) is built against one numpy ABI, and a single unpinned install can move numpy
and silently break `import` for unrelated code. So the model is **integrity-safe by
construction** — and the way that safety is achieved is that ABA *describes* environments
while **weft realizes them**, content-addressed and locked:

- **ABA describes; weft realizes — through one doorway.** An environment is a **spec** ABA
  hands to the compute substrate; weft solves it to a locked, content-addressed **EnvID** and
  materializes the on-disk prefix. Every environment operation goes through
  `core/compute/ports.py` (`env_ensure` / `env_evict` / `env_status` / `session_*`), and the
  *only* `import weft` in the tree is `core/compute/adapter.py:105`. So the realization
  strategy (a local directory, a squashfs image mounted read-only on a cluster node, a remote
  site) can change without touching a caller. See [`compute-sites.md`](compute-sites.md) for
  the site/adapter surface this shares.
- **Never mutate a *shared* environment in place.** A base is **immutable and shared**
  (content-addressed — nobody can shadow-break it); a project's live installs land in that
  project's **own** weft session; an isolated env is **frozen** and grows only by solving a
  *new* EnvID. One project can't corrupt another or the base.
- **The lock is the durable truth; the prefix is a rebuildable cache.** An EnvID names a
  solved lock. The materialized prefix is disposable — evicted or garbage-collected, it
  rebuilds from the lock on next use. This is what makes reclaiming disk safe and what makes
  the *same* env reproducible on a second machine.
- **Verify by loading, and fail loud.** A capability is confirmed by actually importing it
  (not `find_spec`); a broken or missing env is surfaced (startup self-check,
  `gpu_capability_ok`), never left as a latent landmine.

## The model

Environments are realized by weft and identified by **EnvID** (weft's content-addressed
identity). ABA keeps per-project `name → EnvID` handles in `PROJECTS_DIR/<pid>/weft_envs.json`
(three namespaces: `envs`, `active`, `default`). Three tiers, all Python **and** R:

```
 bundle envs/ facet (role: base) ─► env_packs.pack_spec ─► env_ensure ─► EnvID
                                                                            │
   base pack (base_env) ───clone──► project default (project_env)          │
   immutable, shared,               a weft SESSION, per-project:           │
   content-addressed                · kernels + local one-shot runs        │
   (adopt a published image,        · ensure_capability → session_install  │
    else solve locally)               (installs land LIVE, in place)       │
                                     · session_snapshot → a frozen EnvID    │
                                       for background jobs / exports        │
                                                                            │
   named / isolated envs (named_envs) ── extend ──► a NEW EnvID ───────────┘
   frozen; extend never installs into a frozen env
   the ONE weft doorway: core/compute/adapter.py → core/compute/ports.py
```

- **Base pack** (`core/compute/base_env.py`) — the shared scientific foundation, declared as
  a bundle `envs/` facet with `role: base`, a per-language `languages:` list, and a verbatim
  weft `spec:` block (plus optional `import_names`). `require(language)` resolves it — there is
  **no served-base/micromamba fallback**: a deployment that runs a language **must** declare a
  `role: base` env pack (a missing one is a loud, structured misconfiguration). `env_id()`
  **adopts** an EnvID from a published catalog when one exists (the managed-cluster path —
  `seeding.publish_base_packs` / `adopt_env_id`), else solves the spec locally.
- **Project default env — a weft session over the base pack** (`core/compute/project_env.py`).
  The per-project default is a **session** off the base. What a session *runs from* is the
  substrate's fact, consumed as weft's **runtime block** `{source: session|base, env_id,
  prefix, activation, ns_wrap, direct_exec}` (`session_runtime`, observation-only): the clone
  may be **lazy** — a zero-delta session runs from its base realization in place
  (`source: "base"`, identity = the base EnvID) until the first `session_install`
  **materializes** its own clone (the *flip moment* — the install result carries the fresh
  block, and a mutated session is honestly identity-less scratch until snapshot). ABA never
  probes prefix existence for liveness (`ensure()` asks `session_runtime`; only a truly
  pruned session rebuilds + replays recorded additions), and one-shot lanes compose commands
  through `project_env.argv_for_runtime(...)` — direct `prefix/bin/*` exec only when
  `direct_exec`, else through the activation line (inside `unshare -rm` when `ns_wrap`;
  squashfs bases are mount-scoped and have no path outside their activation).
  `interpreter()`/`prefix()` refuse typed (`session.no_direct_exec`) rather than hand out a
  dangling path. Against a pre-runtime (eager-cloning) weft, an activation-shaped shim
  (`_shim_runtime`) synthesizes the block — deleted once every deployment's weft exposes
  `session_runtime`. `ensure_capability` installs land **live** in the session
  (`session_install`). Because a live session is mutable, background jobs and exports don't
  run it directly — they run a `session_snapshot` **EnvID** (frozen, dirty-cached; weft
  returns the base EnvID for a zero-delta session rather than minting a duplicate). The
  registry is the `default` key of `weft_envs.json`. Guard: `tests/test_lazy_session_lane.py`
  runs the lane under BOTH substrate personalities (eager and lazy) × both topologies
  (direct-exec and activation-only).
- **Named / isolated envs** (`core/compute/named_envs.py`) — the escape hatch for a hard
  conflict or a deliberately-pinned stack: a fully separate, **frozen** EnvID. `create(...)`
  solves a fresh one; `extend(name, packages)` adds packages as an `extends_env` layer over the
  current EnvID → a **new** EnvID the handle then points at — it **never installs into a frozen
  env**. Each named env carries its own persistent kernel and its own reproducible lock.
- **Selection — which env runs a bare call** (`named_envs.resolve_env(project_id, language,
  explicit=None)`): the ONE policy every execution lane resolves through. An explicit
  `env=` wins (`''`/reserved names → the default session); else the project's **active
  pointer** for that language (the `active` namespace of `weft_envs.json`, a per-language
  map written by `set_active_env(name, language=…)` — bind-time validated: the env must
  exist and match the slot's language); else the default session. A dangling pointer falls
  back to the default session with a printed warning. Promotion is what makes an isolated
  env *ambient*: bare `run_python`/`run_r`, background submits, remote kernel/sync runs,
  `ensure_capability` installs (and their success probes), and the package-status probes
  all follow the pointer — for R this is the only route to make a package that needs
  **system libraries** the base lacks available to bare calls (the session overlay carries
  packages, never system libs). Census guard: `tests/test_env_resolution.py` forbids
  private pointer reads and unlisted default-session consumers (rationale-annotated
  allowlists), so a new lane cannot silently opt out of the policy.

CLI tools that are *executables*, not importable libraries (samtools, STAR, nextflow), are a
content-addressed **tool env** of their own (`named_envs.ensure_tool_env`), exposed to runs via
PATH — the weft successor to the old micromamba tools env.

## Provisioning — adding a capability on demand

The agent calls `ensure_capability(name)` (`content/bio/tools/discovery.py`). The request is
**normalized once** into a `CapRequest` (`content/bio/tools/cap_request.py` — the single place
tool arguments and the capability record are merged; explicit input wins; empty strings are
absent) and travels to whichever door serves it, so a field the agent sent cannot evaporate at
a door that never learned of it. The capability record itself (catalog entity + bundle
composition) is owned by [`bundle-and-content.md`](bundle-and-content.md).

- **Target resolution.** Explicit `env=` (reserved names → session) → the project's **active**
  pointer for the request's language → the default session. The installer lands where bare
  runs execute; promotion does not change what a request means (the same request through the
  pointer and through explicit `env=` produces identical substrate plans — guarded). An
  ambiguous language consults both slots; exactly one set slot decides, two stay ambiguous —
  never guess.
- **Session installs ride the substrate's `ensure_available` verb.** Registry/conda-sourced R
  requests go **ranked** (`project_env.ensure_ranked`, `lanes=["conda","cran"]`; secondary
  registries via `cran_repos`): the substrate derives per-lane spellings, verifies inside the
  lane loop, and returns typed per-lane `attempts`. Eco-explicit installs go **tagged**
  (`project_env.install(eco=…)` → the verb's tagged mode) with verify-first pre-check and
  record-gating below the API. Pre-verb substrates degrade to `session_install` byte-identically.
- **Named lane → a frozen env, claims enforced by the substrate.** `named_envs.create/extend`
  solve a new EnvID (history kept); the request's **claim** (load names + version floors,
  composed by `cap_request.verify_block`) rides the spec / the env-target verb call. Readiness
  carries honest enforcement facts as a branchable field: `verification: "verified_now"` (claim
  proven live against a ready realization) or `"deferred"` (recorded on the identity, enforced
  at every realization — a broken build surfaces at first use, typed). There is **no
  consumer-side load probe** (it forced a cold env's first realization at install time).
- **Failure rendering is typed end to end.** Error results carry the substrate's `attempts`
  verbatim; the missing-system-library remedy keys **solely** on the substrate's
  `hints.failure_class == "missing_system_lib"` (no text matching — the consumer-side sign
  taxonomy is deleted, tombstone-guarded); remedial doctrine lives in the system-bundle
  playbook rule (`system_bundle/rules/env_failures.md`), not in composed prose; a failed
  install whose (prefix-stripped) name matches a capability card quotes the card's headline.
  Positive import probes are memoized per identity (`core/exec/verify.py` — sessions key on
  (session_id, rev), frozen envs on EnvID; negatives never cache).

The result envelope is a **pinned cross-repo contract** (`tests/schemas/ensure_envelope.schema.json`,
byte-compared against the substrate's copy; `tests/test_ensure_envelope_contract.py`).

`core/exec/materialize.py` is now only the **subprocess run harness**: `MaterializingExecutor`
supplies the ABA-runtime venv that *launches* a one-shot script (`_base_env`), while the
science interpreter comes from the weft env. Its old `materialize()` provisioning dispatch
(pip-into-overlay, conda, container) **raises `NotImplementedError`** — conda and tool envs are
weft's now.

The local run lane selects its interpreter accordingly (`core/exec/run.py`):
`env=<name>` → `named_envs.interpreter()`; a pre-resolved job-spec snapshot → that EnvID's
python; else the default → `base_env.require("python")` + the session **runtime block**
(`project_env.runtime()` → `argv_for_runtime`, topology-blind). The best-effort env
fingerprint is skipped (never faked) when no direct interpreter path exists.

## Platform membership (multi-site envs)

An env lock's **platform set is part of its identity**: adding a platform yields a **new**
EnvID solved for all members. ABA's specs lock for the **controller's** platform by default;
when a run targets a site with a different OS/arch, weft surfaces a typed
`env.platform_mismatch` at realize time and ABA re-locks **lazily, once**, then transparently
retries:

- **Named env** — `named_envs.ensure_platform(project_id, name, platform_str)` re-solves from
  the row's **persisted `base_spec`** (its `python_version` pin included) and replays each
  `extend()` layer as an `extends_env` link, adding the target platform (`env_ensure(update=True)`).
  Replaying *as built* is load-bearing: reconstructing from a flattened package list once
  silently re-locked a pinned-3.10 env to the default 3.12 and dropped the layering.
- **Base / project default** — `base_env.ensure_platform(language, platform_str)` re-solves the
  verbatim pack spec for the added platform → a new EnvID (a live session's dirty extras don't
  travel — the same trade the snapshot lane makes).

Callers wire the retry-once in three places, at parity: the one-shot detached submit and its
poll-side resubmit (`core/jobs/weft_submitter.py`), and the interactive remote kernel lane
(`core/exec/kernels/weft.py`). Solve cost and platform-availability failures land on the remote
attempt, never on local work — a package with no build for the site's platform fails **that**
submission with a named cause. See [`jobs-and-hpc.md`](jobs-and-hpc.md) and
[`compute-sites.md`](compute-sites.md).

**`env='system'`.** An explicit lever for stdlib-only steps (downloads/transfers, listings,
checksums): `env='system'` (or `'none'`) skips pack realization entirely and runs the machine's
own `python3` off PATH — right for a step a 1.5 GB scientific env would serve nothing. Env choice
is orthogonal to execution mode: a synchronous `site=` step gets the same **persistent session**
as any env, just attached bare (`WeftKernelSession` with neither `env_id` nor `session_id`;
weft's `kernel_start` default), so state carries between calls; a detached job runs one-shot on
the node interpreter and is graded `env_grade: node-system` on its exec record
([`provenance.md`](provenance.md)). Nothing is installable into a bare kernel — `ensure_capability`
targets the project session, not the node's interpreter.

## Integrity, verification & disk reclaim

- **Real-import verification** (`verify_python_imports`, `core/exec/verify.py:22`) — a
  capability is confirmed by importing it, not by `find_spec`; a present-but-unloadable
  (ABI-mismatched) package is caught, not reported ready.
- **Content-addressing *is* the ABI guard.** There is no per-install version-pinning step because
  there is no incremental mutation of a shared base to guard: a named env is a single frozen solve,
  a session install re-solves the project's own env, and the base is immutable and shared by EnvID.
- **Read-only diagnostics** (`core/exec/env_integrity.py`) — `env_overview` / `env_layers` /
  `python_package_status` probe the **weft session** (the (i)-drawer Env tab);
  `ensure_sys_executable` recovers an empty `sys.executable` at startup.
- **Safe disk reclaim via eviction** (`core/modules/reconciler.py`). Because the lock is the
  durable truth, reclaiming a pack-backed module's bytes is `env_evict(env_id, site)` — the env
  rebuilds from its lock on next use (`ensure_realized` / `_run_realize_task` with `force=True`
  bypass weft's memo so an evicted prefix actually rebuilds). If weft refuses because a
  session/kernel/job holds the env, ABA stops **only kernel-less session holders** and retries
  once; live kernels and jobs are surfaced honestly, never killed. (Pre-weft, "reclaim disk"
  rmtree'd a dead `$TOOLS_ENV` path and silently did nothing — the bug this closes.)
- **Background-job env parity** ([`jobs-and-hpc.md`](jobs-and-hpc.md)) — a job runs the same
  base/session env as an interactive run (as a `session_snapshot` EnvID, or a named env's EnvID),
  realized on the node by weft; `slurm_entry` reads the activated env off `$CONDA_PREFIX`, so a
  cluster `module load` can't shadow the interpreter.

## GPU / accelerator (target hardware)

A step's *hardware-variant* need (a CUDA build of torch vs the CPU build) is a distinct axis
from its *library* needs, and lives at the **base** tier, not the library tier:

- **Hardware variant → the base, chosen at install** (deployment-conditional). `torch` arrives
  transitively via `scvi-tools`, and conda-forge's default is the **CPU-only** build; a GPU
  deployment builds a **CUDA** base instead. The choice is one toggle in `$ABA_HOME/config.env`
  — `ABA_ACCELERATOR=cpu|cuda` (+ optional `ABA_CUDA_VERSION`) — written by the linux/cluster
  installer (which auto-detects a `gpu` Slurm partition) and applied by
  `install/core/inject-accelerator.sh`, which injects a CUDA `torch` pin into the base spec. A
  CUDA torch is a **superset**: it uses a GPU when present and falls back to CPU on the login
  node / CPU jobs, so one base serves both. The base builds on the GPU-less login node — there
  is no build-time GPU — so the installer exports `CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA` to let the solver accept
  the CUDA build (and select the CUDA major); `11.8` is the widest-compat default (driver
  ≥450.80, GPUs P100…H100). **Non-torch GPU frameworks** (jax[cuda], RAPIDS) are the library
  axis — a session install or an isolated env, not the base.
- **Certainty across nodes = discover-once + verify-at-use** (ABA runs on a CPU login node; a
  job runs on a GPU node ABA can't observe):
  - **`gpu_usable`** — a node-independent readiness hint in the agent's per-turn cue
    (`core/exec/compute_env.py`), true when a GPU is present *and* the base torch is a CUDA
    build (`torch_cuda_build`, `verify.py:96` — a property of the build, not of runtime GPU
    visibility). If a GPU exists but the base is CPU-only, the cue **warns** so the agent runs
    on CPU / tells the user instead of submitting a job that silently falls back.
  - **Verify-at-use** — a GPU-requested job is preflighted on the compute node via
    `gpu_capability_ok()` (`verify.py:72`, called in `core/jobs/slurm_entry.py`); no usable GPU
    → it **fails fast** rather than training on CPU on an idle allocated GPU (the scVI-on-CPU
    incident: right placement, CPU base).
  - **`aba doctor` / startup self-check** — a deployment declaring `ABA_ACCELERATOR=cuda` with a
    CPU-only base is flagged, with the fix named (set the toggle + rebuild the env).

**Shared-FS reachability under Slurm** (`env_integrity.check_envs_dir_shared` /
`check_base_dir_shared`). A background job on a compute node must be able to *reach* the env the
controller provisioned, and *how* it reaches it depends on the delivery mode: with **bare
offload** (a native install or a slim SIF) the node runs the interpreter directly, so the env
area **and** base must sit on **shared FS**, classified empirically by mount fstype
(`/proc/self/mountinfo`), not path prefix; with **wrapped offload** (`ABA_JOB_WRAP=sif`, a fat or
weft SIF) the job re-enters the image via `apptainer exec`, so an in-image base is correct, not a
defect. Under the default **weft SIF profile** the image bakes only the slim controller runtime —
the science envs are **weft images adopted read-only on the node** (via the site's `ro_roots`,
the deployment's published env tree) — so an offloaded job reaches its interpreter either way.
Install-time is a hard gate (`aba doctor` + a definitive `sbatch` probe on a native install); a
loud-but-boot **runtime self-check** surfaces the rest on `/api/health` (`degraded` +
`warnings[]`) and `/api/admin/selfcheck` — the guard that still fires under a SIF/OOD deploy where
the install-time probe can't run.

## Known gaps

- **Accelerator selection is an install-time base fact, not yet a weft site fact.** The
  `ABA_ACCELERATOR` toggle (`weft_fate="move:site"`) drives the installer's base build today; its
  intended home is per-**site** weft config, so that one controller could dispatch CUDA work to a
  GPU site and CPU work elsewhere from a single base description. That migration is not built —
  the CPU/CUDA choice is still a per-deployment base variant.
- **Install-time GPU verify & build-on-target.** Per-job `gpu_capability_ok` verifies at *run*
  time, but ABA does not yet confirm at *install* that the built CUDA runtime initializes on each
  GPU partition (driver new enough), nor build node-arch-specific artifacts (source-only wheels,
  `-march=native`, CUDA extensions) on the target partition. The login-node build is the wrong
  hardware for those; a per-partition build-into-a-job + wheel cache is designed, unbuilt.
- **Stale in-code docstrings.** `core/exec/materialize.py`'s module header still describes the
  `ENVS_DIR/pylib` overlay — pre-weft text; the code raises. Trust the behavior described
  above, not that header.
- **Legacy cascade fallbacks exist only for pre-verb substrates.** The R session lane and the
  session install path keep `session_install`/try-except branches reachable solely when the
  substrate lacks `ensure_available` (guarded); they are deletion candidates once no deployed
  substrate predates the verb. `run_installer` remains outside the ranked vocabulary (explicit-
  cmd ranked entries are a tracked substrate follow-up).
- **Probe memoization is a consumer stopgap.** The identity-keyed positive-probe memo
  (`core/exec/verify.py`) duplicates what the verb's verify-first pre-check does below the API;
  it stays until the already-importable shortcut path also rides the verb, then deletes.
- **Pre-parity named R envs lack `r-irkernel`.** New named R envs bake it (as python bakes
  `ipykernel`), so named/promoted R runs get a persistent per-env kernel; an env created
  before that parity has no kernel package, so its kernel can't start and runs degrade to
  the env's own stateless one-shot with a loud warning naming the one-time remedy
  (`ensure_capability('r-irkernel', env=name)`). No automatic migration.
- **Two consumers still compare against the default session regardless of the pointer**
  (census-allowlisted, with rationale): the provenance env-diff (`lifecycle/revisions.py`,
  "current env" = default session — a pointer-aware diff is backlog) and the viewer
  launchers' converters (`viewers/launchers/pagoda3.py` — the converter's own deps live in
  the platform-managed default session, but a serialized R object whose classes live in the
  user's promoted env would need *both* stacks at once; a two-sided dependency with no
  composition story yet).
- **Direct-path residue outside the default lane.** The default lane — including the
  capability layer's import probes (`_default_probe_argv`, a per-call command builder
  consumed by `verify_python_imports(argv_builder=…)`, so a post-install verify sees the
  flipped session) — is topology-blind. Remaining residue: `named_envs.interpreter()` still
  hands out a bare prefix path (mount-scoped named-env realizations would need the same
  activation treatment — `named_envs.run_in` already routes through weft when no ready
  prefix exists), and a few presentation surfaces are direct-exec-only by construction
  (`env_layers` site-dir scans, `_session_site_dirs`, the viewer launchers' interpreter
  resolution, run-lane env fingerprints). Presentation residue degrades honestly (omitted
  layer / skipped fingerprint) and under-reports on activation-only topologies; migrating
  it to argv/runtime consumption is backlog. Lesson recorded: a typed refusal is only
  "honest degradation" where the caller has an alternative — on a lane with none it is an
  outage (the mounted-base extend bug).
